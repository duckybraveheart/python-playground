# Python Playground
This is my own testing ground for random programs. Some are complete others are still a work in progress.

I use this for practice or as a scratchpad for ideas.

## Current Finished Projects
- **Python Mailer:** Send email with python.
- **Ducky DDOS:** Ethical hacking tool used for testing an IP with a simulated DDOS attack.
- **Slug PortScan:** Basic port scanner to scan first 1000 ports. Dont use only for POC/Practice, also not multi-threaded.
